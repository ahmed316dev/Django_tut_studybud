### It's a simple CRUD application

- Users can register and login
  - they can update their avatar, name, username, email and bio
- Users can create room and chat in other rooms
- All rooms are listed on the home page, along with room topics and recent activities from users
- Users can edit and delete rooms they have created
  - And delete messages that they sent
- The app also exposes a REST API with endpoints to fetch all rooms on the app or a single room by providing its id
